In SysML’s Internal Block Diagram (IBD), InformationFlow is used to model the transmission of information or signals between different parts of the system. It does not directly represent a structural connection but semantically describes who transmits what information to whom. Typical applications include representing flows of control commands, data instructions, status feedback, and other non-physical entities. In XMI representation, InformationFlow corresponds to the uml:InformationFlow element, often used in conjunction with Connectors to ensure consistency between model structure and behavior.

Key Elements of InformationFlow
Each InformationFlow must specify one or more conveyed information items, which are usually of type InformationItem. These represent the abstract content of the transmission.

The conveyed information items do not require detailed attribute definitions but serve to describe the content being transferred. For example, a power control information flow may convey an information item named "Pwr Control" without detailing its internal data structure.

Source and Target
The two core components of InformationFlow are informationSource and informationTarget, indicating the origin and receiver of the information.

In an IBD, these typically point to Ports of a Block, representing the output interface and the receiving interface, respectively.

These Ports must be predefined in the model and have clear directionality (e.g., using ProxyPort or FlowPort with defined directions).

When nested part structures are involved, informationSource and informationTarget can be precisely located via the path mapping of ConnectorEnd to a specific sub-level port within the subsystem.

RealizingConnector Association
To enable structured modeling, an InformationFlow can be linked to an existing uml:Connector via the realizingConnector property, indicating that the information flow physically or logically transmits along that specific connector.

This association ensures the modeled information exchange is grounded in an actual structural connection.

If no realizingConnector is defined, the InformationFlow is considered abstract and will not be reflected in the physical connection structure.

Modeling Best Practices
Each InformationFlow should have a clearly defined name to enhance readability and traceability.

If the conveyed information item originates from an InformationItem’s ownedUseCase, it is recommended to nest the information item within a classifier and reference the transmitted object explicitly via xmi:idref.

This practice supports reuse and consistency verification, especially in complex systems or multi-level subsystems with numerous information flows.

Modeling Constraints
InformationFlows must not be defined between nonexistent or unconnected source and target ends.

Conveyed information item types must exist within the model and should avoid duplicate definitions.

The information source and target must be recognizable model elements (such as Ports, Properties, or the classes themselves).

When using realizingConnector, its ConnectorEnd references must point to valid connection endpoints.

Recommended Usage
It is advised to combine InformationFlow modeling with FlowPort or InterfaceBlock to improve semantic expressiveness.

InformationFlow modeling not only enhances the behavioral description capability of the model but also facilitates future simulation, verification, and requirements traceability.

Thus, InformationFlow acts as a critical bridge connecting structural modeling with behavioral modeling.
