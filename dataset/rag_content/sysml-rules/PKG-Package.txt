In the SysML modeling framework, a Package serves as a fundamental organizational unit for grouping, encapsulating, and modularly managing model elements. Within the .xmi file format, uml:Package acts as the top-level container for all structures, nesting other model elements such as classes (uml:Class), interfaces (uml:Interface), use cases (uml:UseCase), data types (uml:DataType), as well as subordinate packages (uml:Package) through the <packagedElement> tag. This nested structure allows modelers to organize system structure and behavior hierarchically, ensuring clear layering and manageable logic.

In practice, each uml:Package element typically has a unique xmi:id and a name attribute, where the name reflects the logical name of the package. The naming should follow consistent conventions—such as "1-Requirements", "2-Structure", "3-Use Cases"—to represent the thematic content and functional classification of the package. Each Package may contain any number of packagedElement items, which constitute the specific content within that package.

Structurally, Package nesting is recursive, allowing construction of arbitrary hierarchical package structures. For example, a top-level package like “Spacecraft Mission Context” can include sub-packages such as “1-Requirements,” “2-Structure,” and “3-Use Cases.” These sub-packages can be further refined internally—for instance, the “2-Structure” package may define specific Blocks, Associations, Abstractions, and other structural elements. In modeling tools like MagicDraw, such hierarchical packaging facilitates diagram management, access control, and team collaboration.

Modelers should adhere to the following principles when using Packages:

Semantic Consistency and Naming Conventions: Package names should reflect their domain content. Using ordered numbering (e.g., "1-Requirements", "2-Structure") improves model navigability and ensures consistent documentation exports.

Element Encapsulation: All model elements such as uml:Class, uml:Association, uml:Activity, uml:Signal, etc., must belong to some Package to maintain ordered model structure. This facilitates import/export, subsystem reuse, and unit verification.

Cross-Package Referencing Mechanism: Although elements reside in different packages, cross-package references are possible using XMI’s xmi:idref mechanism (e.g., Association ends may reside in separate packages). This supports modular and decoupled system design.

Model Specialization Management: Packages can semantically inherit or specialize one another via Import, Merge, or custom extensions. For example, general elements can be placed in a “10-Supporting Elements” package and referenced/shared by multiple other packages.

Model Reuse and Distribution Support: Common models (such as signals, states, general data types) can be separated into standalone Packages for reuse, improving modeling efficiency and consistency. In collaborative engineering, responsibility for model parts can be assigned by package.

Coordination with Behavioral Elements: Within .xmi, Packages can include behavioral elements (e.g., uml:Activity, uml:StateMachine, uml:SignalEvent) as packagedElement. Relationships such as Abstraction, Allocate, and Refine can link these behaviors to structural elements, forming semantic mappings between structure and behavior.

Furthermore, under SysML’s extension mechanisms, structural elements within a package can be stereotyped (e.g., sysml:Block, sysml:ValueProperty, sysml:Allocate). These stereotypes are generally applied via another element (such as MD_Customization_for_SysML__additional_stereotypes:ValueProperty) referencing the original UML element through base_* properties. It is important that these stereotype bindings reference elements within the current package or packages referenced by it to avoid semantic drift or model inconsistencies.

In summary, Package is the core unit in SysML models that carries modular structure, behavioral content, and system relationships. By designing rational package structures and hierarchical organizations, models gain maintainability, reusability, and extensibility, providing a foundational mechanism to support modeling of large, complex systems. Modelers should build sustainable systems engineering model architectures based on clear semantics, well-defined structure, and rational referencing.
