ConstraintBlock is a SysML modeling element used to define system constraints and formulas, typically corresponding to a uml:Class stereotyped as sysml:ConstraintBlock. It encapsulates parameters (Constraint Parameters) and constraint expressions, representing performance, behavioral, or structural restrictions within the system.

The following rules apply to XMI-formatted SysML ConstraintBlocks, compatible with additional stereotypes generated by tools such as MagicDraw.

1. Definition and Association Rules for ConstraintBlock
A ConstraintBlock is represented as a uml:Class element in XMI, identified by the sysml:ConstraintBlock stereotype.

The ConstraintBlock must reference a base class (base_Class), which is typically a uml:Class element defining relevant attributes and interfaces (e.g., a Block representing system functions or structure).

The base class usually contains multiple ownedAttribute elements, often defined as uml:Ports, representing the input/output parameters that the ConstraintBlock accepts.

2. Constraint Parameter Rules
Parameters of a ConstraintBlock are stereotyped as ConstraintParameter on the base class’s Ports, indicating that these ports serve as variables for constraint inputs and outputs.

Each ConstraintParameter is bound to a corresponding uml:Port via the base_Port property.

The naming of Port attributes should be semantically clear (e.g., “revisit time,” “coverage”) to explicitly express the physical quantity or logical variable represented by the constraint parameter.

ConstraintParameters’ ports are generally private (visibility="private") and have aggregation kind composite to ensure encapsulation of constraint parameters.

The number of ConstraintParameters should comprehensively cover all parameters involved in the ConstraintBlock, ensuring that the constraint expressions are complete and solvable.

3. Constraint Expression Rules
A ConstraintBlock usually contains ownedRule elements to define constraints. These are of type uml:Constraint and associate with constrained elements (constrainedElement) and expression specifications (specification).

Constraint expressions typically use OpaqueExpression, embedding mathematical formulas or logical statements as text.

Constraint expressions must reference variables based on ports defined as constraint parameters to maintain consistency between parameters and expressions.

For complex systems, it is recommended to use structured expression languages (such as MathML) or formula languages supported by compatible tools to enhance constraint verifiability.

4. Inheritance and Reuse of ConstraintBlock
ConstraintBlocks can reuse existing constraint definitions via inheritance, expressed through generalization relationships of the base class.

Subclass ConstraintBlocks can extend or refine constraint parameters and expressions defined in parent classes, enabling hierarchical management of constraints.

During inheritance, parameter naming and typing compatibility must be ensured to avoid semantic conflicts in constraints.

5. Typical Structure Summary
ConstraintBlock (sysml:ConstraintBlock)

base_Class: points to the Class owning ports and constraint expressions

ConstraintParameter (MD_Customization_for_SysML__additional_stereotypes:ConstraintParameter)

base_Port: points to the Port defined in the Class

ownedRule (uml:Constraint)

constrainedElement: model elements under constraint

specification (OpaqueExpression): constraint expression

6. Modeling Recommendations
Maintain one-to-one correspondence between ConstraintBlock parameters and the base class ports to ensure constraint completeness.

Port names and types must accurately reflect parameter semantics for clarity and subsequent analysis.

Constraint expressions should be as complete and executable as possible to facilitate automated verification and solving.

Use inheritance mechanisms to manage complex constraint systems and improve model maintainability.
