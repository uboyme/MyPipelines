InterfaceBlock is a key SysML modeling element used to define interface specifications, typically describing communication boundaries and interaction contracts between systems or subsystems. It is essentially a specialized class (uml:Class), distinguished by the stereotype sysml:InterfaceBlock. An InterfaceBlock mainly consists of properties (Ports or Properties) and ports (such as Port, ProxyPort, FlowProperty), reflecting the structural and behavioral characteristics of the interface.

1. Definition and XMI Representation of InterfaceBlock
In XMI format, an InterfaceBlock is represented as a uml:Class element stereotyped with sysml:InterfaceBlock. It is associated with a corresponding base class (base_Class attribute points to the Class’s xmi:id).

The base class contains the concrete interface structure definitions, including ports and properties.

2. Property and Port Definition Rules
Interface elements defined in the base class associated with an InterfaceBlock are typically ownedAttribute elements, with types mostly uml:Port or uml:Property.

These attributes must have explicit names that represent the meaning of data or signals in the interface (e.g., “p1”, “p2”, or properties referencing other classes).

Visibility of these attributes is usually set to public to ensure interface openness.

Aggregation kinds are generally composite (ports as composite parts) or default association relationships.

3. Port Types and Stereotype Extensions
Common port types within InterfaceBlock include:

Port: Standard ports representing interface connection points.

ProxyPort: Marked with the stereotype sysml:ProxyPort, indicating the port acts as a proxy, typically used to forward messages or signals. In examples, a ProxyPort is linked via the base_Port property to a specific Port in the base class.

FlowProperty: Marked with the stereotype sysml:FlowProperty, representing properties with data flow direction, usually accompanied by a direction attribute (such as in, out, or inout) to specify data flow direction explicitly.

4. Directionality and Data Flow Specifications
For FlowProperty, the direction must be explicitly specified to indicate whether the data flow is input (in), output (out), or bidirectional (inout).

The directionality of ports and properties is central to the interface specification, ensuring consistent understanding of data and signal flow between interacting parties.

ProxyPorts typically serve as proxies for ports and do not individually specify direction; their corresponding base class Ports carry the responsibility for concrete data interactions.

5. Association Types and Reuse
InterfaceBlock supports type associations with other classes, e.g., the ownedAttribute in the base class may point to other classes via the type attribute, representing hierarchical and reusable interface structures.

This association supports modular interface design, allowing complex interfaces to be composed of multiple sub-interfaces.

Inheritance and implementation mechanisms can extend or refine InterfaceBlocks, enabling polymorphism of interfaces.

6. Typical Structure Summary
InterfaceBlock (sysml:InterfaceBlock)

base_Class: points to the Class owning interface properties

ownedAttribute (uml:Port or uml:Property)

name: name of the port or property

visibility: typically public

aggregation: e.g., composite

type: if associated with other classes, points to their xmi:id

Stereotyped port extensions:

ProxyPort (sysml:ProxyPort)

base_Port: links to base class Port

FlowProperty (sysml:FlowProperty)

base_Property: links to base class Property

direction: in / out / inout

7. Modeling Recommendations
Attribute and port names in the base class of an InterfaceBlock should accurately reflect interface semantics to ensure clarity of interface definitions.

Port types and directions must be clearly defined to avoid ambiguities in interface usage.

Appropriately use ProxyPort and FlowProperty stereotypes to enhance expressiveness and reusability of interfaces.

Interface design should consider modularization and hierarchical structure to facilitate maintenance and scalability.
