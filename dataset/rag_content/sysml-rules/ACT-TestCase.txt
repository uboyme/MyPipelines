In SysML, TestCases can be modeled by associating uml:Activity or uml:Operation elements with the sysml:TestCase stereotype to realize verification of specific system requirements. In typical usage, an Activity represents the detailed execution flow of a test behavior, while the Activity’s specification attribute references a uml:Operation. This Operation is in turn referenced by the sysml:TestCase through the base_Operation property, forming a complete test modeling chain. This pattern embodies the principle that: the Operation defines the test interface, the Activity describes the test procedure, and the TestCase defines the test requirement.

Specifically, a TestCase is usually implemented by an Activity behavior that realizes the test flow. This Activity may contain multiple CallBehaviorAction nodes, each invoking a lower-level Activity representing operational steps in the system test, such as “Sense Thermal Emissions,” “Display Imagery,” or “Measure Resolution.” These nodes are connected via ControlFlow and ObjectFlow edges to model control logic, the sequence of data transfer, and dependencies among input/output objects. This structure clearly expresses the logical integrity and traceability of the test process.

In behavior modeling, test activities are partitioned into different ActivityPartitions to express the responsibilities or roles of participating objects in the system test. For example, a test may involve objects such as the System-Under-Test, Signal Processor, and Display, each allocated to distinct ActivityPartitions. Each Partition uses the represents attribute to link to a uml:Class (representing the corresponding physical or logical component), and allocation from behavior to structure is realized via AllocateActivityPartition relationships. This partitioning mechanism enhances the structural organization of the test model and supports alignment between the model and system architecture.

Additionally, common modeling elements in test activities include InitialNode and ActivityFinalNode, which mark the start and end of the test flow; multiple InputPins and OutputPins serve as parameters or results of actions, respectively used to input test conditions or capture test outcomes; and combinations of CallBehaviorActions form the backbone of the test flow, enabling modular reuse of existing sub-test logic or subsystem behaviors.

When using uml:Operation as the core organizing element for tests, the model typically exhibits the following structure: an Operation node is linked via its method property to an Activity, and this Operation is simultaneously referenced by a TestCase. This modeling pattern emphasizes interface-driven design, suitable for validation modeling and requirements traceability scenarios, facilitating integration with requirement models. Conversely, if a TestCase directly references a base_Behavior as an Activity, it is more appropriate for process-oriented or flow-driven modeling contexts.

Overall, testing modeling in SysML stresses the tight integration of structure, behavior, and verification objectives. TestCases describe not only the test behavior itself (e.g., specific flows, invocations, decisions) but also establish relationships with system components through partitions, define interface semantics through Operations, and express process flows through behavioral modeling. This combination of interface, behavior, and structure supports the reusability, verifiability, and maintainability of test models.
